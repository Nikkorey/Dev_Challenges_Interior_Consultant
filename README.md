## **Description**

For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I was given a design mockups using figma for a mobile and desktop layout. I had to match the designs perfectly, where I had to write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. I use SASS to code the CSS and I use Flexbox to arrang. Then, using min-width media queries, I had to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for desktop screens. I use Javascript to have interaction in the hamburger menu navigation.

I Fulfill the user stories below:

 * User story: I can see a page following the given design
 * User story: On mobile, I can see a collapsed navigation
 * User story: On mobile, when I select the hamburger menu, I can see a navigation
